# CSharp Plugin Example

Another older project but a bit newer, having been played with in 2014. I had a fascination with the plugins available for the audio player [Winamp](http://winamp.com/) and wanted to experiment with what was available in .Net. While examples exist in other places, I hope this illuminates the process for other people by keeping the project functional but small with a straight forward linear approach to the code.

If you want to use plugins in your code, I'd recommend using this code sample as a base:

[Stack Overflow - Writing C# Plugin System](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1070826)

While getting this repo ready for publishing I ran across an article at MSDN on doing something similar in Core:

[Create a .NET Core application with plugins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/creating-app-with-plugin-support)

## Finally

With the prevalence of plugins in CMS (like Wordpress) this is an important concept to know. You can allow users to add functionality to your software and publish your own features in a component like architecture without requiring a revision or deployment. There's quite a lot of funtionality in plugins that seems underutilized and unexplored, even today in 2021.
